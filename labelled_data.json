    "content": "Copper yellow string light I ordered from other popular brands, but everytime i was getting normal plastic cool white string light. I was pissed off with orders- reorders- exchange & return. Finally I saw this one & thought of giving a try. The string light delivered I was exactly looking for the same, copper wire, golden yellow & full bright lights. Usb cable is also long. One suggestion if the seller can improve the packaging quality. I am not sure about durability, but looks like it\u2019s durable as it has copper string.",
